        <p class="gameDescription">If variety is the spice of life, then Heroes of the Storm is the MOBA genre’s ghost
            pepper. Recognizable characters from Blizzard’s most iconic games face off against each other on themed maps
            with unique objectives that serve as lightning rods
            for teamfights. Heroes of the Storm also takes a more simplified and accessible approach to the genre that
            bucks MOBA trends by implementing a streamlined talent system and team-shared experience. It doesn’t always
            work, but when its at its
            best Heroes of the Storm can be one of the most varied and exciting 5v5 competitive games around.</p>
        <p class="gameDescription">This is a MOBA with all the hallmarks of a Blizzard-produced game: a punchy art
            style, responsive controls, and loads of stuff to do to work toward satisfying unlocks. But most
            importantly, Heroes of the Storm’s take on the MOBA formula is distinctive
            because it’s willing to kill some of the genre’s sacred cows in order to make its mechanics easier to learn
            and its matches flow differently.

        <p class="gameDescription">
            In stark contrast to the slow burn of epic-length cutscenes that greet you in previous Persona games,
            Persona 5 starts its long journey with a bang by throwing you directly into a fast-paced foot chase through
            a vibrant, stylized Tokyo casino. That’s
            a bold move, and it’s emblematic of the entire experience. As we’re introduced to the complex yet
            approachable turn-based battle system in those opening moments, series fans will recognize not only
            returning systems from Persona 3 and 4, but
            also long-absent elements like ranged weapons and negotiation that haven’t been in a Persona game in over a
            decade, adding more depth and variety to combat. Persona 5 is the culmination of everything the JRPG series
            has been building to, with
            familiar elements dialed up to 11 and some welcome new surprises added into the mix.
        </p>
        <p class="gameDescription">In what’s by far the series’ strongest story to date, Persona 5 puts you in the
            capable shoes of a high school student who spends his evenings saving the world. By day, you’ll attend
            class, answer quiz questions, and live the life of a typical
            teenager, but after school you'll see the clever concept of invading the minds of corrupt adults who are up
            to no good and battling psychological demons in order to change their hearts.</p>

        <p class="gameDescription">Very few things in life can make me as happy as a great Pokemon RPG, and Sword and
            Shield repeatedly left me in a state of pure, child-like joy. The elated surprise of not knowing what’s
            coming is something this series does extremely well if you
            can manage to play it relatively unspoiled (fear not, this review won’t deprive you of that), and I’m glad
            that sense of wonder is still alive and kicking in Sword and Shield. With every new game in this 23-year-old
            series, changes big and
            small are always made, but I’ve never been willing to declare the latest entry the new gold standard for
            Pokemon because they’ve consistently been a balance of better and worse. But the first mainline game on the
            Switch has changed that: though
            there is still no “perfect Pokemon game,” the 40-plus hours I’ve spent with Sword and Shield have left me
            comfortable with calling them the best Pokemon games I have ever played – and I’ve played ‘em all.</p>
        <p class="gameDescription">Experiencing the avalanche of improvements made me realize just how complacent I’d
            become with Pokemon mechanics that were, in hindsight, less than ideal. While this series has always been
            great about introducing new players with thorough tutorials,
            it seems crazy that experienced players have never been able to skip them until now. Just tell the NPC you
            know what’s up and they’ll get out of the way and let you get down to the business of catching and training
            – you can even catch Pokemon
            without being told how, and doing so automatically skips the tutorial. Likewise, travel across the map has
            been made fast and convenient, and even connecting with other people is as simple as pressing the Y button.
            And perhaps most overdue
            of all, Sword and Shield have killed the sacred cow of the traditional random encounters that have all too
            often made exploring feel like a slog. All throughout, Sword and Shield feels like it respects your time.
